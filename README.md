# 🚗 BMW CarData → MQTT Bridge

After BMW disabled access for *bimmerconnected*, an alternative solution was required.  
The best working replacement is the new **BMW CarData MQTT streaming interface**,  
which this bridge connects to and forwards to your local MQTT broker.

A small C++ bridge that connects **BMW ConnectedDrive CarData (MQTT)** to your **local Mosquitto MQTT broker**.  
It authenticates via the official BMW OAuth2 device flow and continuously republishes vehicle telemetry in real time.

You can run it **directly on Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi** or inside a **Docker container** – both options are fully supported.

---

## 🧩 Features

- MQTT v5 protocol with reason codes and reconnect logic  
- Automatic **token refresh** using BMW’s `refresh_token`  
- Local **watchdog & reconnect** if the BMW broker drops the connection  
- Publishes a small JSON status message (`bmw/status`) showing online/offline state  
- Lightweight: depends only on `libmosquitto`, `libcurl`, and `nlohmann/json` (header-only)  
- Runs perfectly on Debian, Ubuntu, or Raspberry Pi OS  
- **Docker support** with ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml`

## ⚙️ Requirements

Tested on:
- Debian 12 / Ubuntu 22.04+ / Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm
- libmosquitto ≥ 2.0
- libcurl ≥ 7.74
- g++ ≥ 10
- (optional) Docker ≥ 24 with Compose plugin

---

## ⚙️ Installation

You can install and run the bridge either **natively (bare metal)** or via **Docker**.

---

### 🧩 Option 1 – Classic Installation (without Docker)

For direct use on Debian, Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi OS.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dj0abr/bmw-mqtt-bridge.git
cd bmw-mqtt-bridge
cp .env.example .env
nano .env   # see section "Get Your BMW IDs" below

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Install dependencies
./scripts/install_deps.sh

# Compile
./scripts/compile.sh

# Run OAuth2 Device Flow
./scripts/bmw_flow.sh

Open the displayed URL in your browser, log in,  
then return and press **ENTER**.

# Then start the bridge:

./src/bmw_mqtt_bridge
```

---

### 🐳 Option 2 – Docker Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository and prepare the environment
git clone https://github.com/dj0abr/bmw-mqtt-bridge.git
cd bmw-mqtt-bridge
cp .env.example .env
nano .env   # see section "Get Your BMW IDs" below

# Build container
docker compose build

# Authenticate with BMW
docker compose run --rm bmw-bridge ./bmw_flow.sh

Open the displayed URL in your browser, log in,  
then return and press **ENTER**.

# Start bridge
docker compose up -d
```

The bridge will now automatically stream BMW CarData to your local MQTT broker.

## 🆔 Get Your BMW IDs

Before you can use the bridge, you must retrieve your personal **BMW CarData identifiers**.

1. Go to the [MyBMW website](https://www.bmw-connecteddrive.com/)  
   (You should already have an account and your car must be registered.)
2. Navigate to **Personal Data → My Vehicles → CarData**  
3. Click on **"Create Client ID"**  
   ⚠️ *Do **not** click on "Authenticate Vehicle"!*
4. Copy the **Client ID** and insert it into the `.env` file
5. Scroll down to **CARDATA STREAM → Show Connection Details**
6. Copy the **USERNAME** and insert it into `.env` file as **GCID**
7. The other options in the `.env` file are for advanced setups – you can safely ignore them in most cases

After this setup, your bridge will be able to authenticate against the official BMW CarData MQTT interface.

---

## 📝 Notes

- For direct usage, your MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) must run locally on `127.0.0.1`.
- If you run the broker on another host, change the IP in `src/bmw_mqtt_bridge.cpp`:

```cpp
#define LOCAL_HOST "127.0.0.1"
```

- Both variants (bare metal and Docker) use the same scripts and logic — only the environment differs.

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- BMW CarData is a private API — use responsibly.  
- Never publish or share your `id_token` / `refresh_token`.  
- Tokens expire automatically; the bridge refreshes them securely.  
- Keep your Mosquitto broker private or protected by authentication.

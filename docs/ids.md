# üÜî Get Your BMW IDs

Before you can use the bridge, you must retrieve your personal **BMW CarData identifiers**.

The script `scripts/bmw_flow.sh` automatically creates  
`~/.local/state/bmw-mqtt-bridge/.env` and guides you to fill in the IDs which  
you get with the following procedure:

1. Go to the [MyBMW website](https://www.bmw-connecteddrive.com/)  
   (You should already have an account and your car must be registered.)
2. Navigate to **Personal Data ‚Üí My Vehicles ‚Üí CarData**  
3. Click on **"Create Client ID"**  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è *Do **not** click on "Authenticate Vehicle"!*  
4. Copy the **Client ID** and insert it into the `.env` file  
5. Scroll down to **CARDATA STREAM ‚Üí Show Connection Details**  
6. Copy the **USERNAME** and insert it into `.env` file as **GCID**  
7. The other options in the `.env` file are for advanced setups ‚Äì you can safely ignore them in most cases  

After this setup, your bridge will be able to authenticate against the official BMW CarData MQTT interface.

At **CARDATA STREAM** don't forget to click `Change data selection` and activate the topics you want to receive.
